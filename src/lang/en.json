    "text": "After working 10 years in the occupational health sector, I felt the need to learn new things and express my creativity. Becoming a web developer quickly became an obvious choice. I first trained independently for a year, then started a certified program with OpenClassrooms in 2024. This portfolio is the final step of that program — and I hope the first step toward new professional adventures!"
