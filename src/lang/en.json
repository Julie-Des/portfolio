    "text": "After working for 10 years in the field of occupational health, I felt the need to learn new things and express my creativity. Becoming a web developer quickly became obvious to me. I first trained on my own for a year, then started a degree program at OpenClassrooms in 2024. This portfolio is the final step of that journey, and I hope the first towards new professional adventures!"
